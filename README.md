## Credits

### Local Storage

I learned about local storage through the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), and reading the [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp) documentation. I then watched a youtube tutorial by [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesQQuick) to see how to use local storage in practice and applied those methods in my code to create highscores.

### API

I learned the use of API's (Application Programming Interface) through [freeCodeCamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw&t=8252s) youTube course, and followed a youTube tutorial on the [Pokemon API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37vxWr0WgQk&t=673s) to get a better understanding of API's in practice. I also created a small project using a few different API's before applyig these methods in my code for Quiz Crunch.
The API used for this site is the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/).

### Further Features

There are many featured I implemented that I had learned through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
I had followed their front end development course and many of their additional youTube tutorials, learning the use of multiple JavaScript methods in addition to the [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/) course materials.
